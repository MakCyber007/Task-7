# Task-7
#**Identifying and Removing Suspicious Browser Extensions**#
This repository documents the process and findings for an internship task focused on browser security.

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this task was to learn how to identify, analyze, and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary browser extensions to enhance security and browser performance.

**Process Overview:**
The task was completed by following a systematic process:

  **Review Extensions:** I accessed the browser's extensions manager to get a complete list of all installed add-ons.
  
  **Analyze Permissions & Reputation:** Each extension was carefully reviewed. I checked the permissions it required, read user reviews.
  
  **Identify Suspicious/Unnecessary Extensions:** Based on the analysis, I identified extensions that were either unused, required excessive permissions, or had a questionable reputation.
  
  **Removal & Observation:** All suspicious and unnecessary extensions were removed. The browser was then restarted to observe any changes in performance or behavior.
  
  **Research:** I conducted research on how malicious extensions can harm users, focusing on data theft, malware injection, and resource hijacking. A summary of this research is included.
  
  **Documentation:** All steps taken, along with the list of removed extensions and the research findings, were documented.
